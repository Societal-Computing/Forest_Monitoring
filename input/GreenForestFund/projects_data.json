    "Description": "The breath of the woods. When trees breathe, they absorb large amounts of CO₂. For this reason, we protect the trees and turn this extensively cultivated logging site into future woodland! We are reforesting this biosphere reserve site, adding more tree species to this former monoculture. Of course, our trees may grow as tall as they want for all their lives. This creates a habitat for maximum biodiversity: a protected shelter for wildlife and nature."

This will provide a wider variety of ecological niches."

By planting over 2,000 trees and revegetating alkaline grassland, we created a new habitat for nature - and a home for deer, wild boars, fire salamanders, lizards, wild bees, bumblebees and butterflies. There is water supply from a picturesque spring, and there are 25 different species of trees contributing not only to maximum biodiversity but also to a great variety of food sources."

We have converted intensively cultivated farmland into a wildflower meadow: a little paradise for wild bees, bumblebees, butterflies and birds. Of course, we used only certified native seeds. We rounded out this protected habitat with fruit-bearing trees, shrubs and a hedge made from dead wood. The bees love it ... and so do all the other wild animals."

We are not going to contradict - instead we have transformed intensively cultivated farmland back into colorful nature to put a smile on everyone's face. We created a protected habitat for wild bees, bumblebees, butterflies and birds. And frogs, newts and other amphibians feel at home here as well: We planted alders and left natural biotopes to ensure ideal living conditions for them. Artificial water drains were removed, allowing the soil to serve as a natural water reservoir once again."

The woodland can now grow undisturbed to become tomorrow’s jungle. This allows the site to protect the climate and serve as a home for plants and animals."
