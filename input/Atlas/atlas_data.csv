The reforestation was carried out on land previously used for agriculture, in forest glades and in places where the forest presents significant degradation rates. In 2022 they reforested with pines and for this year they planted cedars. ReforestAACIÓN has donated 14,500 trees which have been planted on more than 50 hectares. They are really active in all our activities and they always show good disposition. Ejido Ocampo has helped us with soil for nurseries and in tree movement maneuvers.

This pilot project establishes a (preliminary and) scalable model for a regionally-adapted reforestation approach to sequester carbon, restore and conserve biodiversity, and to produce products for harvest and use by local communities. Forests and wooded ecosystems play a vital role in the local landscapes and communities, and are most likely to be successful if they are ‘multi-functional’. The design uses a holistic approach to achieve as many diverse goals as possible, while ensuring the primary goals are met.
 
The design is based on ecological principles that mimic local forest ecosystem dynamics – those of the ‘dry miombo woodland’ – and adapt them to meet the project constraints and goals. The dry miombo woodland is a dominant ecosystem type in the Iringa area (and large areas of Tanzania and east Africa and southern Africa).",Open Forest protocol,https://atlas.openforestprotocol.org,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2, 6, 1]",,,

The Kisii Restoration and Agroforestry project is an aggressive idea which seeks to work with farmers to plant trees in selected water catchment areas and wetlands that have been interfered with by mostly, human activity. 
The organization has agreed with the local farmers on the following gaols that seek to mitigate the effects of climate change; 
1.        Create awareness on the impact of climate change on their livelihoods and actively involve the community in coming up with mitigation measures, both short and long term.
2.        Embrace agroforestry for their ecological and social economic well being. 
3.        Participate in restoration activities where, trees will be planted in areas identified as either rain catchment or wetland/swamp
4.        Protect existing rivers, wetlands, swamps and hills that are important in influencing rain patterns and biodiversity
5.        And nurture and protect the trees planted for a period of up to 40 years.
