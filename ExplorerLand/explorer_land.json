implemented at the Blomerus site includes the active management of alien vegetation, supporting natural forest regeneration and actively planting indigenous seedlings, harvested from the forest interior, where required and appropriate. Each year in Spring, newly germinated forest seedlings are harvested from the forest floor and reared in the forest nursery. After 2 years, they are ready to be replanted to expand the forest. This tree planting happens at the start of the rainy season to ensure best survival probabilities, by using the dryland planting technique. This technique mimics natural nutrient pockets by using wood chips processed from cleared alien vegetation.\r\n\r\nPlanting at this site was quite varied as there are several microsites within it, including riparian zones and steep slopes. These required careful planning ahead of planting, such as with the construction of terraces on the slopes to ensure the planted trees have the best chance of establishing strong root systems.\r\n\r\nThis site was specifically chosen as it features a stretch of river which has become heavily degraded as a result of deforestation and later alien invasion. By planting here the goal is to strengthen the river banks, preventing further erosion, and to help re-establish a healthy and flourishing riparian system. \r\n\r\nYear planted = 2024\r\nTrees planted = 5,000","project_area":true,"category_name":"natural_forest","category_label":"Natural Forest"}},{"id":"9xdbkyw770gjogwm","type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[19.4481,-34.5701],[19.4486,-34.5706],[19.4484,-34.5707],[19.4483,-34.5706],[19.4482,-34.5706],[19.4483,-34.5708],[19.4481,-34.5709],[19.4481,-34.5707],[19.4477,-34.5705],[19.4481,-34.5701]]]]},"properties":{"id":"9xdbkyw770gjogwm","icon":"reforestation","slug":"F3MAqv","type":"spot","color":"#469612","image":"KFcXB480DxqdsTlm6ALePBfmSTKA4Nvf3hAqIRP0.jpeg","title":"FFL9: Platbos C","zoom_max":12,"zoom_min":15,"published":"public","description":"In 2013, 5,001 trees were planted on Site C, as part of Greenpop’s annual reforestation festival Reforest Fest.

Each year in Spring, newly germinated forest seedlings are harvested from the forest floor and reared in the forest nursery. After 2 years, they are ready to be replanted to expand the forest. This tree planting happens at the start of the rainy season to ensure best survival probabilities, by using the dryland planting technique. This technique mimics natural nutrient pockets by using wood chips processed from cleared alien vegetation.\r\n\r\nYear planted = 2023\r\nTrees planted = 5,000","project_area":true,"category_name":"reforestation","category_label":"Reforestation"}}]
